    <h2>Welcome to TameScheme</h2>
    
    <p>
      TameScheme is a Scheme interpreter written in C#. It is designed to
      provide an easily-embeddable scheme interpreter for .NET projects
      that wish to add scripting, as well as being a competent implementation
      in its own right.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At present, it is under development and implements a fairly limited subset
      of the R5RS specification. The goal is to produce an interpreter with
      complete R5RS compliance. You may also be interested in the 
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tamescheme">project page</a>
      for TameScheme on SourceForge.
