    <h2>Numbers</h2>
    
    <p>
      The .NET number classes (int, float, etc) represent the corresponding
      scheme number types. In addition, there are three scheme number classes
      representing types of number that are part of the set of scheme types
      but not available from .NET.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      These classes are <class>Rational</class>, <class>RationalComplex</class> and
      <class>Complex</class>, which represent respectively an exact rational number,
      an exact complex number and an inexact complex number.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note that presently a decimal is treated as an exact floating point number.
      However, TameScheme is not presently capable of promoting it to a 
      <class>Rational</class>, which limits its usefulness. (.NET 1.1 does
      not appear to provide introspection functions that are required for this)
    </p>
    
    <p>The number classes all implement the <interface>INumber</interface> interface
    which provides a common means of manipulating them, in addition to some
    class-specific functions.</p>
