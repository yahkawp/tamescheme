    csUnit Test Library : "SchemeUnit" Project Overview
========================================================================

The csUnit Test Library wizard has created the "SchemeUnit"
project for you as a starting point for creating your tests.

This ReadMe contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files
that make up your csUnit test project.

SchemeUnit.csproj
    This is the main settings file for project. It contains information
    about the configuration settings for the project.

TestFixture1.cs
    This file contains a TestFixture class to hold tests that csUnit
    will execute. The class has the attribute [TestFixture] to indicate
    to csUnit that it contains tests. Each test should be marked with
    the [Test] attribute. You should add your tests to this file.

AssemblyInfo.cs
    This file contains Global Attributes for the assembly that will
    be created when the library is compiled.
