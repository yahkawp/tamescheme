    <h2>Types</h2>
    
    <p>
      TameScheme is based on .NETs own type system. Most .NET types make sense
      to TameScheme, giving it a much richer set of types than most scheme
      systems. Most types have no special meaning to the interpreter, but some
      types have some specific meaning.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The interpreter just passes 'unknown' types through; ie, the result of
      evaluating a <class>DateTime</class> object, for example, is just the
      <class>DateTime</class> object.
    </p>
    
    <p>(An eventual extension will be the notion of 'evaluatable' classes
    which can provide a different means of evaluation if they're encountered)</p>
