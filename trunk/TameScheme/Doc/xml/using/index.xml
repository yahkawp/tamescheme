    <h2>Using TameScheme</h2>
    
    <p>
      These pages will detail the TameScheme language itself, focussing on
      extensions to the 
      <a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">R5RS</a>
      specification. At present, the language itself is underdeveloped,
      so there's not a lot of interest here yet.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The current revision of TameScheme implements 'if' as a syntactical
      element and '+' as a function, in addition to a mostly complete parser.
      There's a simple test program that you can enter expressions into using
      these constructs. While this is currently a very small subset of scheme,
      it serves to test the framework on which the rest of the language will
      be based.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Future language revisions</h2>
    
    <p>
      Once the R5RS specification is complete, or mostly complete, it is my
      intention to add .NET specific extensions to scheme. Initially, these
      will allow creation and manipulation of .NET objects, but the intention
      is to eventually add a compiler capable of producing .NET classes.
